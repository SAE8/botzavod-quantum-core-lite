# BotZaVOD Quantum Core Lite

This repository contains a lite, safe public demo of the **BotZaVOD Quantum Core**, featuring simplified implementations of several classical quantum-inspired algorithms.

## Modules

- `shor_engine.py` — lite demo of Shor’s factoring method.
- `grover_engine.py` — simplified Grover search engine.
- `hhl_solver.py` — miniature linear‑equation solver inspired by HHL.
- `dolce_engine.py` — gradient‑based optimization toy model.
- `yota_engine.py` — iterative noise‑reduction routine.
- `kva_kva_engine.py` — stochastic resonance pattern search.
- `__init__.py` — module initializer.

## Purpose

This lite package is designed to demonstrate the architecture of modular computation engines inside BotZaVOD without exposing internal IP or industrial logic. All algorithms are simplified and mathematically safe.
